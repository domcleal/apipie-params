Apipie Params
=============

DSL for Hash/JSON descriptions. Describe format of hashes using Ruby
code, generate a json-schema for it and validate values against it.

It's based on the DSL of apipie-rails. See
[its documentation](https://github.com/Pajk/apipie-rails#parameter-description)
for more details. It basically lets you use the param descriptions
outside of Rails controllers.

In this phase, the validation itself is an experimental feature. You
need to install `json-schema` gem explicitly.
